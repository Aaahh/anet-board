# anet-board

Copy the included 'anet' folder into the 'hardware' folder of your Arduino installation.

* On Windows this is likely to be `C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\hardware`.
* On OS X this is located inside the Documents folder in your Home directory. Just click on "Documents" in Finder and look for the `Arduino` directory inside it. The full path is `~/Documents/Arduino/hardware`.
